## Instructions
This is the final project of Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program at Udacity.
I completed this project following Udacity's requirements [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/1090/view) and provided [code](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1).

## Feature
- 
- Made with **responsible design** to ensure great user experience for any devices
- **Offline application** with restaurant information, customer reviews and review form 
- Elements on the page use the appropriate semantic elements according with **ARIA roles**



## Installation

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information.
